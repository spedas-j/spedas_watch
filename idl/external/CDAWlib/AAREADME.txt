Computer System:        Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF)

Brief Description:      This directory contains some software tools written
			in the IDL language.  This is a "library" of routines
			useful for reading in data that is stored in the CDF
			format and also for plotting the data variables as
			time series, images, radar, and spectrograms.  
			In order to use this s/w you must have IDL 
			installed on your local machine.  

IDL versions to use
w/ this s/w:		The CDAWlib s/w has run operationally with IDL5.3, 
			6.1 and 6.3 on mainly unix/linux and PC's.  There
			are known problems w/ reading CDFs w/ IDL6.2 
			so that version will not work.  If using CDAWlib
			with IDL6.3 you must also install the CDF API IDL 
			bug fixes found at: 
			http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/idl62_or_earlier_and_cdf3_problems.html  
			We will be beta testing IDL6.4 with CDAWlib in 
			Feb. 2007.  

Software Distribution:  The software files are provided in two ways.
			The source directory contains the individual files.
			The unix directory contains the files in a tar and
			tar/gzip file. 

README.unix		How to extract the s/w from one of the following files.
CDAWlib.tar		The s/w is provided as a "tar" file.
CDAWlib.tar.Z		The s/w is also provided in a "tar" file that has
			been compressed using the "compress" utility.
CDAWlib.tar.gz		The s/w is also provided in a "tar" file that has
			been compressed using the Gnu "gzip" utility.

Usage Instructions:     Basic instructions are at:
