CDAWlib CDF data reading, plotting and listing software written in IDL.

UNIX Installation Instructions:
------------------------------

This software is provided in several different forms, please use one of
the following that is suitable for your system and its utilities: 
as a "tar" file compressed with the "compress" utility, compressed using 
Gnu "gzip", and not compressed.  

To uncommpress 'CDAWlib.tar.Z' use the uncompress command as follows...

   uncompress CDAWlib.tar.Z

To uncommpress 'CDAWlib.tar.gz' use the gzip command as follows...

   gzip -d CDAWlib.tar.gz

In either case the resulting file will be named 'CDAWlib.tar'.

Then use the "tar" command to extract the source files.  "tar" will
put all of the CDAWlib IDL source files into the current working directory
and will generate a subdirectory called jh that will contain a hand full
of John Hopkins routines that are used by the CDAWlib software.

The syntax for the `tar' command is different on some flavors of UNIX.  For
most UNIX systems (and the POSIX shell) use...

     tar -xvof CDAWlib.tar

For the IBM-RS6000/AIX use...

     tar -x -v -f CDAWlib.tar
