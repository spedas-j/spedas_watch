How to update your CDF and/or GEOPACK versions 

Important: Please contact your system administrator first.

To update the CDF (or GEOPACK) dlm files with those included in SPEDAS, 
you have to copy two files from the SPEDAS directory 
and paste them into your IDL directory, 
replacing any files with the same name. 
To accomplish this, you need the appropriate administrative permissions. 
Follow these steps: 


1. CDF version 3.6.2
Locate and copy the two (or three for win64) files under: 
<SPEDAS installation>/external/dlm_files/cdf_dlm/<your OS>


2. GEOPACK version 9.3
Locate and copy the two GEOPACK files under: 
<SPEDAS installation>/external/dlm_files/geopack_dlm/<your OS>


3. Paste the above CDF (or GEOPACK) files into the appropriate 
IDL directory for DLM files. This directory is shown in the Help->About boxes.
This directory varies, depending on which IDL version you are using 
and how IDL was installed.
For example, for Windows the appropriate directory could be:  
C:\Program Files\Exelis\IDL85\bin\bin.x86_64
