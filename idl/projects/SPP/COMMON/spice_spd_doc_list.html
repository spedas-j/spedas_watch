NAME: SPP_SPICE_KERNELS
 function: spp_spice_kernels(name)
PURPOSE:
 Provides maven spice kernel filename of specified type
  
Typical CALLING SEQUENCE:
  kernels=mvn_spice_kernel() 
TYPICAL USAGE:
INPUT:
  string must be one of:    Not implemented yet.  currently retrieves ALL files
KEYWORDS:
 LOAD:   Set keyword to also load file
 TRANGE:  Set keyword to UT timerange to provide range of needed files. 
 RECONSTRUCT: If set, then only kernels with reconstructed data (no predicts) are returned.
OUTPUT:
 fully qualified kernel filename(s)
 
WARNING: Be very careful using this routine with the /LOAD keyword. It will change the loaded SPICE kernels that users typically assume are not being changed 
PLEASE DO NOT USE this routine within general &quot;LOAD&quot; routines using the LOAD keyword. &quot;LOAD&quot; routines should assume that SPICE kernels are already loaded.
