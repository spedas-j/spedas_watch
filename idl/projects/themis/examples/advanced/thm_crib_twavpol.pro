;Purpose:
;  
;  This version stores these outputs as tplot variables with the
;  specified prefix
;         These are follows:
;
;         Wave power: On a linear scale, at this stage no units
;
;         Degree of Polarisation:
;		This is similar to a measure of coherency between the input
;		signals, however unlike coherency it is invariant under
;		coordinate transformation and can detect pure state waves
;		which may exist in one channel only.100% indicates a pure
;		state wave. Less than 70% indicates noise. For more
;		information see J. C. Samson and J. V. Olson 'Some comments
;		on the description of the polarization states
;		of waves' Geophys. J. R. Astr. Soc. (1980) v61 115-130
;
;         Wavenormal Angle:
;		the angle between the direction of minimum
;		variance calculated from the complex off diagonal
;		elements of the spectral matrix and the Z direction
;		of the input
;		ac field data. For magnetic field data in
;		field aligned coordinates this is the
;		wavenormal angle assuming a plane wave.
;
;         Ellipticity:The ratio (minor axis)/(major axis) of the
;		ellipse transcribed by the field variations of the
;		components transverse to the Z direction. The sign
;		indicates the direction of rotation of the field vector in
;  		the plane. Negative signs refer to left-handed
;		rotation about the Z direction. In the field
;		aligned coordinate system these signs refer to
;		plasma waves of left and right handed
;		polarisation.
;
;         Helicity:Similar to Ellipticity except defined in terms of the
;	direction of minimum variance instead of Z. Stricltly the Helicity
;	is defined in terms of the wavenormal direction or k.
;	However since from single point observations the
;	sense of k cannot be determined,  helicity here is
;	simply the ratio of the minor to major axis transverse to the
;       minimum variance direction without sign.
