General:
----------------------------------------------------

Derived spectra are generated using THM_PART_PRODUCTS, a command line routine
for creating energy and angular spectra from ESA and SST data.  A list of routines
detailing command line usage is given at the bottom of this document. 
The available spectrograms are:

Energy Spectrogram:
  -The data are averaged across all look directions to create an omni-directional energy spectrogram.

Phi Spectrogram (spin axis longitude):
  -The data are averaged across all energies and latitudes (measured from spin plane to spin axis).

Theta Spectrogram (spin axis latitude):
  -The data are averaged across all energies and longitudes (measured along the spin plane).

Gyrovelocity Spectrogram:
  -The data are transformed into field aligned coordinates then averaged across all energies and latitudes.

Pitch Angle Spectrogram:
  -The data are transformed into field aligned coordinates then averaged across all energies and longitudes.


Options:
----------------------------------------------------

Angular Range Limits:
  -Limits are applied to the data before calculating data products.
  -Phi, and theta limits will affect all spectrograms.
  -Gyrovelocity and pitch angle limits will only affect field alligned spectrograms.

Energy Range Limits:
  -Limits are applied to the data before calculating data products.
  -Energy limits will affect all spectrograms.
  -No limits are applied unless the checkbox is selected

FAC Resolution:
  -After being transformed to field aligned coordinates the data are interpolated onto a 
   regular grid in the new coordinates. These fields specify the resolution of the new 
   grid along longitude (gyrovelocity) and latitude (pitch angle).
  -Large values may significantly increase the time and memory required to process the data.

FAC Variant:
  -All field aligned coordinates use the magnetic field vector as their z axis.  
   The full coordinate system is determined by selecting one of the following options:
     xgse:  the x axis is the projection of the GSE x-axis
     ygsm:  the y axis is the projection of the GSM y-axis
     zdsl:  the y axis is the projection of the DSL z-axis
     RGeo:  the x is the projection of radial spacecraft position vector (GEI)
     mRGeo:  the x axis is the projection of the negative radial spacecraft position vector (GEI)
     phiGeo:  the y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector (GEI), positive eastward
     mphiGeo:  the y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector (GEI), positive westward
     phiSM:  the y axis is the projection of the azimuthal spacecraft position vector in Solar Magnetic coordinates
     mphiSM:  the y axis is the projection of the negative azimuthal spacecraft position vector in Solar Magnetic coordinates

SST Contamination:
  -Select the checkbox to remove the default set of bins that are thought to be contaminated before processing.

Start Angle:
  -The Start Angle specifies the lower bound of the y axis for phi and gyrovelocity plots. 
      e.g.: 180 -> y axis drawn from 180 to 540 degrees
            -90 -> y axis drawn from -90 to 270 degrees
